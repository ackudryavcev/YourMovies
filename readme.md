#HYF Homework. Own movie search app
=============================================================
You can see work version here - [https://ackudryavcev.github.io/YourMovies/](https://ackudryavcev.github.io/YourMovies/)
----
The project uses The OMDb API and only features of this API
----
The project allows you to search for movies in the search bar and add movies to your favorites. You can also add year and type of movie to the search
----
When searching, you can only see 10 movies - these are API features
----
In your favorites, only 9 films are displayed at a time, with more than 9 films in your favorites, navigation buttons appear
----
When you add to favorites on the cover of the movie you see a red cross, otherwise the cross will be white
----
Favorites are stored in the browser's local storage, so you can only see your favorites on 1 browser
----
Used in the project: CSS, HTML, JavaScript
----
You can also download the folder with the code to your computer, extract it and run the index.html using the life server
----
No libraries were involved
----
So far, there are no plans for the development of the project.
----
Below are the initial plans for the project and their implementation is marked.
