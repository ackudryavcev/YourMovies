# HYF Homework. Own movie search app
=============================================================
######  You can see work version here - [https://ackudryavcev.github.io/YourMovies/](https://ackudryavcev.github.io/YourMovies/)
----
######  The project uses The OMDb API and only features of this API
----
###### The app is fully responsive for all screen resolutions.
----
######  The project allows you to search for movies in the search bar and add movies to your favorites. You can also add year and type of movie to the search
----
######  When searching, you can only see 10 movies - these are API features
----
######  In your favorites, only 9 films are displayed at a time, with more than 9 films in your favorites, navigation buttons appear
----
###### When you add to favorites on the cover of the movie you see a red cross, otherwise the cross will be white
----
######  Favorites are stored in the browser's local storage, so you can only see your favorites on 1 browser
----
######  Used in the project: CSS, HTML, JavaScript
----
###### The project has the following structure: in the root directory there is an index.html file and app.js - the start file for the java script and data.js - contain data about selected films, then in the views folder you can see the pages that can be displayed in the application - search cards, error or watch selected films, in the public folder are collected pictures, icons and a file with styles and in the feature folder you can see files with basic functions - add to favorites, request to the server and search for movies
----
######  You can also download the folder with the code to your computer, extract it and run the index.html using the life server
----
######  No libraries were involved
----
######  So far, there are no plans for the development of the project.
----
######  Below are the initial plans for the project and their implementation is marked.
